# code refactor

## Description

Code refactor is a project I took on in order to refactor starter code for Horisean marking agency.I optimized their code to increase web accessibility so that people with disabilities can access their webpage and also so that it ranks higher in search engines.

- fixed broken links
- added semantic HTML elements
- refactored redundant CSS code

## Usage

The webpage has a navigation bar on the top right side which the user can select one of the options they would like to learn more about.

Selecting on of the 3 options will direct the user to a section that will provide some more information about the option they slected.

There is also an aside section of the webpage that provides the user with additional info on Horiseon's services.
